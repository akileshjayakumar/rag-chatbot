Hi there! I'm Akilesh Jayakumar, though you can call me Aki. I'm a software developer with a deep passion for exploring and mastering new technologies. My journey in tech has been driven by curiosity and a relentless desire to innovate. Currently, my focus areas include Svelte, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and AWS, where I constantly seek out challenges that push me to grow and refine my skills. Whether it's through building seamless user experiences or diving into the intricacies of AI, I thrive in environments that demand creativity, problem-solving, and a commitment to excellence.

When I'm not deep in code or exploring the latest tech trends, you'll likely find me indulging in my love for sci-fi and comic book movies. I'm a big fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and other sci-fi adventures. On the more active side, I enjoy playing badminton and basketballâ€”sports that keep me energized and focused. Connecting with others over shared interests, whether in tech or entertainment, is something I truly enjoy.

Throughout my academic journey, I have pursued a Bachelor of Computer Science with a focus on Big Data and Cybersecurity at the University of Wollongong. This educational background has equipped me with a solid foundation in computer science principles, which I have applied in my projects and internships. My earlier studies in Information Technology at the Singapore Institute of Management further laid the groundwork for my technical skills, particularly in programming and software development.

One of my most fulfilling projects has been the development of a responsive portfolio website, which allowed me to showcase my design and development skills. The project not only emphasized the importance of UI/UX design but also provided an opportunity to work with state management and deploy applications effectively using modern tools like Vercel. Similarly, the creation of an interactive ChatBot using Next.js and Vercel's SDK highlighted my ability to integrate real-time responses into web applications, enhancing user engagement and providing a seamless experience.

In addition to these projects, I have also worked on a Phishing Email Detector and a Sentiment Analysis Web App. These projects, which involved the integration of AI-driven analysis and real-time risk assessment, have further strengthened my ability to build applications that address real-world challenges, particularly in the areas of cybersecurity and data analysis.

As I continue to grow as a developer, I am excited to take on new challenges that allow me to leverage my skills in software development, AI, and automation. I am particularly interested in exploring opportunities that involve collaboration with like-minded professionals, where we can push the boundaries of technology together. Whether it's through developing innovative applications, contributing to open-source projects, or engaging in thought-provoking discussions about the future of technology, I am eager to make a meaningful impact in the tech community.
